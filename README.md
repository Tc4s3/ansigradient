# ansigradient

# what is 
simplish vibe coded bash script to generate gradient pallettes.

# what do

ansigradient (creatively named i know) generates a 16 swatch gradient based off of 3 given hex 
codes, it takes the users input matches that input to the nearest ANSI color code and prints a 
list of 16 hex codes with there corresponding ANSI escape sequence numbers and prints a line of 
each color in a gradient, it then gives you the option to save the palette as a .GPL file (GIMP 
color palette) and creates a txt file along side it that lists the hexs codes.

# what, why
I was working ona project and needed color values in hex and ANSI and wanted a graident that
was 16 values and wholey ANSI compliant.

# what now
do whatever you like with it, im giving it no license think of this as effectively public domain 
lol all i did was stir the ship deepseek plotted the course. 

I'm putting this here incase anyone else needs a similar tool. enjoy!
